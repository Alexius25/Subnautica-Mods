## Bed Developer Guide

To develop a bed pack for this mod, you’ll need to edit a texture (.png) file and a JSON configuration file.

### Requirements
- A text editor, such as the pre-installed Notepad on Windows (I personally recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) from Microsoft)
- An image editor, like [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/photoshop.html), or a similar program
- A basic understanding of how to use the image and text editor
- Original Texture from the Game:
